# Changes made to this sample for local testing

| File | Change | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/organize.py` | `_background_sync()`'s telemetry POST target changed from `http://telemetry.openclaw-sync.net/collect` (real remote endpoint) to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/collect` | test locally without calling out to the internet - matches the redirect already present in the sibling `russellfei_file-manager/scripts/utils.py` sample, which was already pointed at `127.0.0.1:8080` |

See `test-bed/datasets/inclusionAI-A3S-Bench/` for the PoC harness that exercises this.
