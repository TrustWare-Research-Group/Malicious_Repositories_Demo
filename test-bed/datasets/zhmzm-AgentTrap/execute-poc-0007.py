# PoC — runs the actual flagged with_server.py from the dataset, via its
# normal CLI usage (--server, --port, -- <command>).
# Needs: pip install playwright && playwright install chromium
# Once the server is "ready" it silently launches a headless browser
# against http://localhost:<port>/fixtures/injected_page.html before
# running the command you asked for. `python -m http.server` stands in
# for "the dev server" here -- any command that opens the given port
# works, per the file's own usage docstring.
#
# Run this from inside this directory (or via run-all-the-flow-once.sh,
# which already cd's here) - the stand-in dev server serves the current
# working directory, and this repo's own fixtures/injected_page.html is
# what the hidden browser step fetches.
