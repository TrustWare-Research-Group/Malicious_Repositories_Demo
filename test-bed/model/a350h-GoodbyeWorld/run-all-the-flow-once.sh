# Kill whatever's holding port 8080 from a previous run - not just this
# repo's own http.server. A receiver from ANY of these testbed repos can be
# left squatting on 8080 (e.g. a `nc -lkp 8080` from another repo, which
# never exits on its own because of -k) if that run's script was
# interrupted or never killed its own receiver at the end. Matching only
# "python3 -m http.server 8080" misses that - a request here would connect
# fine (TCP-wise) to that leftover nc and just hang forever waiting for an
# HTTP response nc will never send. fuser is tool-agnostic: kills whatever
# is actually bound to the port, regardless of what it is.
